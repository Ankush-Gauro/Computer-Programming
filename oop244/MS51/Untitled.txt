 I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

While completing this milestone project of Pre-Triage Application, I had the opportunity to go through notes and practice many useful and advance concepts of OOP in c++. I used a lot of operator overloadings specially the insertion (<<) and extraction (>>) operators I used virtual functions and templetes and many other OOP concepts.
	I stumbled at many parts while coding this project, and got a lot of errors however the notes of oop we very useful in solving many confusions. I also used help of many online lessons from youtube to understand a concept like virtual function really well. Overall this was a very good experience.
