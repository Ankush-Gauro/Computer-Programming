 I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

While completing this workshop 3, first of all on the first part (the lab part), I got to work upon the concepts of Constructor and Destructor. In car.h I had to use this on the Car() method, this really helps in tidying up the memory deallocation after the use of the object. For this I had to carefully re-read the encapsulation part of oop244 notes many times to completely grasp the concept. I also got to use the concepts of output formatting using setw() from the iomanip library to set the width of the output fields. I had to use this in the display function of Customer.cpp and Car.cpp to perfectly match the output so that the files can be submitted in the matrix. Next, in the second part of the workshop (the DIY part), I got to utilise the output formatting a lot as in the first part I also had to make the icecream image like in the expected output document inside the vendor.cpp file using symbols like @, #, V and others. I also used the concepts of input validation to check for valid input using cin.fail(), clearing input buffer and displaying error messages in the Icecream.cpp file.
